## Oral presentation instruction

You are asked to give an oral presentation of work on two Horloge tasks of your choice. It will take place next friday and you are asked to complete two tasks by then. The presentation will consist of presenting your work, which will be assessed against the following:

- you can justify why you chose to prioritise the two tasked you picked 
- you should present at the minimum one - probably more - *relevant* unit tests that should cover the most critical use cases for your tasks
- appropriate use of at least two of the following non-trivial programming concepts: destructuring, immutabilitiy, modules, context binding, callbacks, recursion and constructors

Note that it is possible to work on tasks that are not yes referenced in the issue board. In that case, just make sure you create new tickets for them on Github or Waffle before you present. Give your issue a clear description showing why this is needed and what is the nature of the underlying work.

You will present as a group. You might want to use slides. The evaluation will happen has follows:

- Presentation of you work: 7mn
- Discussion about your work: 5mn
- 3 questions from the lecture: 3mn

Participation should be spread accross participants.
