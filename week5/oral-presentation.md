## Oral presentation instructions

You are asked to give an oral presentation of work for two Horloge tasks of your choice. The presentation will be held next friday and will be assessed against the following aspects of your work:

- you can justify why you chose to prioritise the two tasked you picked 
- you should present at the minimum one - probably more - *relevant* unit tests that should cover the most critical use cases for your tasks
- appropriate use of at least two of the following non-trivial programming concepts: destructuring, immutabilitiy, modules, context binding, callbacks, recursion and constructors.

Note that it is possible to work on tasks that are not yet referenced in the issue board. In that case, just make sure you create new tickets for them on Github or Waffle before you present. Give your issue a clear description showing why this is needed and what is the nature of the underlying work.

You will present as a group. You might want to use slides. The evaluation will happen as follows:

- Presentation of you work: 7mn
- Discussion / questions about your work: 5mn
- Questions from the lectures (up until week 5's material): 3mn

Participation should be spread accross participants.
You are still welcome to send Pull Requests but they won't be merged before all presentations are finished.
