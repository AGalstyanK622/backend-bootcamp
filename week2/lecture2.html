## _Programming Languages_
--------------------------
Programming languages generally fall into two categories,

1. Compiled
2. Interpreted

Examples of (1) include **C**, **C++** and **OCaml**

Examples of (2) include **Python**, **JavaScript** and **Ruby**

(Java isn't exactly 1 or 2 as it compiles to Java bytecode and
then its interpreted by the JVM)

## _Short History of JavaScript_
--------------------------------
The first web browser was called
[**Mosaic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)
and the web itself was made so that physicists could share
research papers. Research papers are static content,
that is they don't change. Think about your HTML,
it doesn't change.

Then businesses discovered the web and immediately interactively was
needed. People needed the websites to do things, to take credit cards,
to animate things, to change the site; for that you need a real
programming language.

## _Short History of JavaScript, cont..._
-----------------------------------------
There was a race to provide a programming language for the web.
[Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) at NetScape,
now at Mozilla, rushed and in eight days created **JavaScript**.
At the time NetScape was in competition with Microsoft and Microsoft
also created a programming language for the web, it was
called **VBScript**

(Because JavaScript was made in only eight days, the
language has some serious mistakes)

One of the reasons why JavaScript won and VBScript died is the former
is open-source and the latter was closed source. This is why JavaScript is also
known as **EcmaScript**, there is an open spec, standard.

### _Engines_
-------------

An engine is another name for an interpreter, remember
that JavaScript is interpreted, not compiled.

The first JavaScript engine, written by Eich, was **SpiderMonkey**, it is
implemented in **C++** and still used in **FireFox**

Today there are quite a few JS engines,

1. SpiderMonkey, used in FireFox
2. Chakra, used in Edge
3. JavaScriptCore, used in Safari, Mobile Safari,
   ReactNative, original version of Chrome
4. V8, created by Google, used in Chrome and the
   foundation of **nodejs**

...and more

### _nodejs_
------------
In this course we will be using **nodejs**, also just known as
**node**.

**node** was made in 2009 by an amazing programmer named Ryan Dahl,
he basically took **V8**, added an event loop and some low-level IO
calls. Since then the project has taken off and now node is used by
basically all startups and big name users like

Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, SAP,
Walmart, Yahoo!, Cisco Systems and many more.

We are learning on the latest versions of node,
which support the majority of ES6 (EcmaScript 6).
